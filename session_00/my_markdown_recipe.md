Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).

In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.

Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.

In a separate bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add this dry mixture to the butter mixture, mixing well after each addition.

Fold in the chocolate chips, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout the dough.

Drop rounded tablespoonfuls of dough onto an ungreased baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.

Bake in the preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes or until the edges are golden brown.

Remove the baking sheet from the oven and let the cookies cool on the sheet for 5 minutes. Then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.

Enjoy your freshly baked chocolate chip cookies with a glass of milk or your favorite hot beverage!
